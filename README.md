# Jammming
## Codecademy API Portfolio Project

### Purpose

This project is part of Codecademy's Front-end path. It is a Web App using the Spotify API to access the user's account, **search for tracks, create and save a new playlist** to their Spotify. 

Right now, the project is deployed and viewable [here](https://bit.ly/jammming
). However, it is required to **have a Spotify account** and **be added to my Spotify allowed users dashboard**.

In my [Profile](https://github.com/JossySola), in the left side you'll find a way to contact me!
