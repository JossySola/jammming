# Jammming
## Codecademy API Portfolio Project

### Purpose

This project is part of Codecademy's Front-end path. It is a Web App using the Spotify API to access the user's account, **search for tracks, create and save a new playlist** to their Spotify. 

The Web App also has some **security filters**, such as a Regex check denying inputs with numbers and symbols, a State parameter in the authorization request to prevent CORS attacks, input fields _required_ attribute and a number limit in the input fields. 

Right now, the project is deployed and viewable [here](https://bit.ly/jammming
). However, it is required to **have a Spotify account** and **be added to my Spotify allowed users dashboard**.
