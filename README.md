# Jammming
## Codecademy API Portfolio Project

### Purpose

This project is part of Codecademy's Front-end path. It is a Web App using the Spotify API to access the user's account, search for tracks, create and save a new playlist to their Spotify. 

Right now, the project is deployed and viewable [here](https://bit.ly/jammming
). However, it is required to have a Spotify account and be added to my Spotify allowed users dashboard.

### Technologies used

+ HTML, JavaScript, CSS
+ React
+ Spotify Web API
