    - [x] The data changes over time.
    - [x] The data is not passed via props.
    - [x] The data is not computed based on existing state or props.

### Spotify API

1. Verifier
2. Challenge
    + SHA256
    + Base 64 Encode
3. Get Authorize Token
4. Get Access Token
5. Refresh Token
6. API Requests

[Authorization Code Grant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1)

##### Example in Verifier step:
> Uint8Array [0: 30, 1: 131, 2: 85, 3: 204, 4: 64...]

> .reduce(callbackFn, initialValue)

> callbackFn = A function to execute for each element in the array. Its return value becomes the value of the *accumulator* parameter on the next invocation of callbackFn.

> (accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex) => expression

> (30,131) => 30 + possible[131 % 62 = 7]

>            (30 = e) + (7 = H)
> (37,85) => 37 + possible[85 % 62 = 23]

>               23 = X

#### Notes
> The `PKCE authorization` flow starts with the creation of a code verifier. A code verifier is a high-entropry cryptographic random string with a length between 43 and 128 characters.

> The code verifier must be transformed (hashed) using the `SHA256 algorithm`. Stands for "Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit", is a hashing function that creates a unique 256-bit hash with 64 characters long for every string. The hashed code verifier will be sent within the user authorization request.

> TextEncoder returns a byte stream with `UTF-8 encoding`.

> The most basic unit of binary is a `Bit`, which is either a 1 or a 0.

> A `Byte` consists of 8 bits, an example: "01101011".

> *window.crypto.subtle.digest*. **Crypto** is an object which allows web pages access to certain cryptographic related services. **Crypto.subtle** property returns a SubtleCrypto which can be used to perform low-level cryptographic operations. A **digest** is a small value generated by a hash function. Ideally, a digest is quick to calculate, irreversible, and unpredictable. Cryptographic digests should exhibit collision-resistance.

> The *btoa()* method encodes a string in base-64. This method uses the "A-Z", "a-z", "0-9", "+", "/" and "=" characters to encode the string.

> In security protocols, a `Code Challenge` is some data sent to the client by the server in order to generate a different response each time. Challenge-response protocols are one way to fight against replay attackswhere an attacker listens to the previous messages and resends them at a later time to get the same credentials as the original message.

> `Spotify Scopes` are categorized data the user will allow or deny access to.

> The `URL constructor` returns a newly created URL object representing the URL defined by the parameters. *new URL(url, base)*.

> *localStorage* stores the code verifier locally, saved across browser sessions. *localStorage* has no expiration time.

> *URL.search* is a search string, also called a query string, that is a string containing a **'?'** followed by the parameters of the URL.

> *window.location.href* is a stringifier that returns a string containing the whole URL, and allows the href to be updated Setting the value of href navigates to the provided URL.

> After receiving a response, we must then PARSE the URL to retrieve the code (an authorization code that can be exchanged for an access token) parameter PARSE means to analize a sequence/sentence.

> *urlParams.get* retrieves the parameter specified between the parentheses from the URL response.
